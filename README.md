# HR Analytics Dashboard
The project aims to identify the key factors responsible for employee turnover. This project utilizes Power BI to provide HR professionals with actionable insights to understand and address the reasons behind employee resignations.


 Data Extraction: I received the data from the client in Excel format.
 Data Transformation: I loaded the data into Power BI and cleaned it by removing any empty or duplicate values, correcting spelling errors, and ensuring the correct data types using Power Query.
 Data Loading: The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
 Data Modeling: I created a logical structure for the data through data modeling, which allows for effective analysis and visualization.
 DAX Formulas: I used the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language to create calculated measures and columns.
 Report Building: I built the dashboard by creating user-friendly reports and visualizations that provide intuitive insights.
